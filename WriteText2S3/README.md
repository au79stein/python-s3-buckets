# write text directly to s3

I was today years old when I realized that you can do this!
You can write a string of text directly to s3 without having to create your own local file and then write that to s3.

## potential use case

there are obviously many, but for me I was thinking of taking the note that I collect from the command line and writing it directly to the s3 bucket.
